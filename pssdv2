Notes on SSD v2 disks                                                      
--- Size ---
SSD v2 disks are available from 1GiB to 64TiB
--- IOPS ---
All disks are deployed with a baseline of 3,000 IOPS
Maximum IOPS per disk is 80,000
Above capacity reaches 6GiB, an additional 500 IOPS per GB is supported
per GiB. A disk requiring 80,000 IOPS must be be at least 160GiB.
--- Throughput
All disks are deployed with 125MiB/s of throughput
There is a ratio of 4K:1 between IOPS and throughput, or in other words,
For every 1000 IOPSs provisioned, a maximum of 250MiB/s can be provisioned 
--- PseudoCode ---
//Check disk size
if size <1GiB or >64TiB
  fail - disk too big or too small
//ensure IOPS is a multiple of 500
if iops % 500 != 0
  fail - iops must be a multiple of 500
//ensure IOPS in range
if iops < 3000 or > 80000
   fail - iops too big or too small
//Checks IOPS fit in disk size
achievable_iops = 3000
if size > 6 and < 160
  achievable_iops = (size -6 ) * 500
elseif size => 160
  achievable_iops = 80000
if iops > achievable_iops
  fail - IOPS not achievable with this disk size
// ensure throughput is in bounds
if throughput < 125 or > 1200
  fail - throughput too big or too small
// ensure throughput is achievable with IOPS
if throughput > (iops/4)
  fail - not enough iops provisioned
